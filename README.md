# anomaly-detection-nab
an anomaly detection on Ambient Temperature System Failure from NAB Kaggle Dataset.

For this Machine learning cases of Anomaly Detection, I use two Algorithm to detect the anomaly. K-means and Isolation Forest.
The Anomaly Detection is quite unique cases. You could approach it with Supervised and Unsupervised, and I choose using the Unsupervised Learning.

This datasets, contains only 2 feature, timestamp and value (Temperature).





This is an Anomaly Detection Machine learning Cases with NAB Kaggle Datasets. This is the link to the Kaggle:
